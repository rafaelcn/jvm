# Style

The code style used in this project is K&R with the 1TBS variation. Some
guidelines are written below:

- **do not** write more than 80 characters in a line
- **do not** open a parenthesis just after something that isn't a function such
  as an if clause.
- **do** comment on code you think wouldn't be understandable without any
  context or to explain why.

If you are reasoning about why or want to modify in any way you can always open
an [issue](https://github.com/jvm/issues/new).

# Modifying code

You are free to modify code the way you see fit but we are no obligated nor we
have the responsability to check (write a test for your case) or to approve the
code in our source, that's why this an _Open Source_ project under the MIT
terms.

Having said that, whenever you feel the urge to fix or implement something
please adhere to the code conventions written in the first section nd send us a
pull request.

# Pull Requests

The style of pull requests we adopt here is the _feature/_, _hotfix/_ branch
style. Is very much like the [gitflow](https://www.gitflow.com/) one.
